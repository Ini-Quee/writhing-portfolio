        <h1>I Help Businesses Turn Words Into Results</h1>
        <p>Not just pretty copy. Real research, real strategy, real growth. If your content isn't converting, let's figure out why and fix it together.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
            <p>I've seen too many good businesses struggle because their message isn't clear. They have great products, passionate teams, and real solutions...but people aren't buying.</p>
            
            <p>Not because the business is bad. Because the copy doesn't connect.</p>
            
            <p>That's where I come in. I help you understand what your customers actually need to hear. Not what sounds clever or trendy. What actually makes them trust you and take action.</p>
            
            <p>My philosophy is simple: <strong>value for value.</strong> I give you my best research, my clearest strategy, and my most honest feedback. In return, I earn your trust and hopefully, your business.</p>

                <h3>A Little About My Journey</h3>
                <p>I didn't start out as a copywriter. I started as someone who loved solving puzzles and understanding people.</p>
                
                <p>I spent years working as a community manager for Web3 companies, where I had to explain complex blockchain concepts to people who'd never heard of crypto. I learned to speak human, not jargon.</p>
                
                <p>I learned that people don't care about features. They care about feeling understood. They care about solutions that actually work.</p>
                
                <p>Now I take that same approach to copywriting. I research deeply, write clearly, and focus on what matters: helping your business grow.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- What I Believe -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What Guides My Work</h2>
            <p>Every project I take on is built on these principles:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research first, writing second.</strong> I don't write a single word until I understand your customers, your market, and your real challenges. Good copy comes from good insights.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Clarity over cleverness.</strong> Fancy words don't sell. Clear explanations do. I write copy that your customers can actually understand and act on.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Honesty always.</strong> If something isn't working, I'll tell you. If your strategy needs adjusting, I'll suggest it. My job is to help you succeed, not to tell you what you want to hear.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results matter most.</strong> At the end of the day, your business needs to grow. That's what I'm here for. Every word I write is aimed at getting you closer to that goal.</p>

        <!-- What I've Learned -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What I've Learned Working With Clients</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, I've had the privilege of working with startups, coaches, community platforms, and businesses at different stages. Here's what I've discovered:</p>
            
            <p>Most businesses don't have a content problem. They have a clarity problem. Once you understand your customer deeply, the right words flow naturally.</p>
            
            <p>The best copy is invisible. It feels like a conversation, not a sales pitch. People buy when they feel understood, not when they're impressed by fancy language.</p>
            
            <p>Research is everything. The more time I spend understanding your market, the less time I spend rewriting. Good insights make good copy easy.</p>

            <h3>Some Things I've Done</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped Web3 companies explain blockchain technology to complete beginners...and watched their communities grow by 40%</li>
                <li>Wrote email campaigns that achieved 25-40% open rates (way above the 15-20% industry average)</li>
                <li>Created educational content that turned confused prospects into confident customers</li>
                <li>Worked across 10+ industries, from tech startups to educational foundations</li>
                <li>Built marketing strategies that generated $10K-$50K revenue increases within 90 days</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Who I Work Best With -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Clients I Love Working With</h2>
            <p>I work best with people who value quality over speed. Who understand that good research takes time, but saves time in the long run.</p>
            
            <p>You might be a coach with an audience but no bookings. A startup that needs to validate their market before investing big money. A business that's stuck at a revenue plateau and needs fresh eyes.</p>
            
            <p>If you're willing to trust the process, open to honest feedback, and serious about growth, we'll probably work great together.</p>
